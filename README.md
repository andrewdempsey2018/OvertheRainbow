## What does it do and what does it need to fulfill?

This project is a collaborative effort from team `Over the Rainbow`, for the June 2021 Code Institute Pride Hackathon. This project is based on the theme of visibility and celebration for the LGBTQ+ community, and advocates of that community.

The team consists of the following developers, for which, without them this project would not have been possible:

#### Irishbecky91 (Rebecca Rayner)

This was my first Hackathon and I absolutely loved it! I was able to learn so much about frameworks from my team that I will be applying to future projects. This was definitely the most difficult part of the Hackathon, but thankfully I had an amazingly supportive team that was able to help me whenever I needed it.

I was given the tasks of making our logo, creating the navbar (which was further styled by my teammates) and creating the accessibility page and internal server error 500 page. The hardest part was the nav bar, as this is the first feature I used Bulma.io on. It was a bit of a steep learning curve as I am only 5 weeks into the course but I loved it nonetheless.

I would also like to say how amazing my team is, in their creativity and ingenuity, and for being so friendly and helpful. It really made my first hackathon experience an amazing one. Live long and prosper :spock-hand:


#### Claire Lemonnier

It has been also an opportunity to explore and use the css library framework [Bumla](https://bulma.io/documentation/overview/start/) and learn about advanced css, such as using variables to create a <a href="https://open.spotify.com/track/2ORrgw8M0ZbrFlm5cpaKCv?si=aef13591a0804ae9">color</a> palette as well as generating templates and html content using python, flask and json files. 

Most importantly, I have shared this experience with amazing people and also learnt a lot about the LGBTQ+ community - from the fights for their rights to the different facets of the community. 


#### Maya Claveau

After one month on the course, I did my very 1st Hackathon in my life, something that I would never imagine I would do before. Joining the cause with absolutely no clue other than some basic HTML and CSS (not finished yet), I challenged myself to a great extent, and I am glad I had the exposure with github, gitpod, bulma.io and even a little bit of Python, how cool is that!

Over the past couple of days, I experienced excitement, frustration, disappointment (solely to myself), lucky for me I have the best team that anyone could ask for. Our team lead Anthony, Andrew and Claire all dedicated so much time to help me with whatever the issues I am facing, encouraging me when I was about to give up. The privacy policy and 404 error page I managed to do wouldn’t be there without their help. From the planning stage to allocating tasks, to producing the code and putting all the puzzles together to have the final website, I am so impressed with the efficiency and productivity of my team, also frustrated with myself that I am not contributing enough. However, the inclusiveness within my team made me feel very comfortable and welcomed. My team’s hunger for learning inspires me and motivates me moving forward.

This experience was unique and I have learnt so much in such a short period of time. It boosted my research skill, thinking skill and creativity among many others, it even rewired my brain a little bit. More importantly, it gave me a better understanding of how software developers work in action. I am proud of myself, went through it and survived. One thing I am certain of is that it surely prepared me better for my upcoming first project. 

Hackathon, I will be back, and promised to do better next time around. 

Love & Peace
Maya


#### Andrew Dempsey

My name is Andrew and I am very proud to have been part of Over the Rainbow, a great team of developers who put their dev skills to work in order to help others and celebrate PRIDE. Our initial team meeting set the tone of how we were going to work going forward - everybody is included, everybody will play a part, everybody has something unique to contribute and everyone will learn something new. Our main method of working together was just to code away, with a call open at all times in case someone needed help. We chatted whilst we coded (and one of us got attacked by a cat live on camera!!). It was a great experience and one that we all learned from, no matter our skill level - there was something in this project for all of us. Most importantly, we hope there is something on our website for the community too.

###### Key skills learned from the project:

* Bulma CSS framework
* Pair programming
* Learned much more about Chrome developer tools
* Experience helping to solve tech problems remotely
* Touched on Socket IO but did not get to implement the planned feature however the experience of using the library will be invaluable going forward
* Far more advanced use of GitHub. Properly reviewing and merging a PR. All team members got experience pushing, pulling, merging and reviewing code. The team also had great exposure to resolving merge conflicts
* Refreshed knowledge of Flask and expanded upon it
